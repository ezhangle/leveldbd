leveldbd
========

LevelDBd is a key/value database server which provides REST API and RPC(Protocol Buffer) service backed up with LevelDB engine.

# Background

Google published a embedded key/value store engine called LevelDB under BSD license.
It's a sort of BigTable implementation and could be sit as a core database engine on NoSQL style database service.
The biggest difference with traditional/other key/value stores like Berkerly DB is that it manages keys in sorted order, this is a greate thing because we can run list operation to get a sorted list of keys along with values that we couldn't so far with other embedded key/value engines, so this feature adds great and great value to LevelDB and make it so suitable to be adopted for NoSQL database service.

LevelDBd uses LevelDB as a back-end db engine and provides remote server functions.
It provides 2 ways of interface:
* REST API as a general purpose interface - Any HTTP client library or web browser can be used to communicate.
* RPC as a programatic interface to maximize the performance. (Not supported yet)

In REST API, it provides 4 key features:
* GET for List of keys
  * Supports iteration with maximum number of keys to list for a single request.
  * Supports delimiter and key filter with regular expression.
* GET/PUT
  * Supports encoding
* DELETE
  * Supports single key deletion, prefix deletion and batch deletion.

## LevelDBCluster?
LevelDBCluster is a fault torrent key/value database based on quorum algorithm and it's one of practical BigTable implementation.

To help understand, simply LevelDBServer is like an individual MySQL server which doesn't provide server level redundancy so if the server fails we loose the data. LevelDBCluster is like a MySQL Cluster that runs many back-end MySQL instances. LevelDBCluster cooperates with many back-end LevelDBServer and provides productionl level rock-solid stability and robustiness along with partitioning feature for infinite scalability. It runs seamlessly regardless of individual server failures. LevelDBCluster is not published yet on the internet but you could contact the author if you're adventerus.

# REST API service

## LIST API

List all keys in sorted order that are prefixed by a given key or within the given range.
```
GET /db/key/ HTTP/1.1

200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 100
x-key: key
x-size: 3
x-format: text
x-encoding: url
x-delimiter: (Not shown if not specified in the request)
x-keyfilter: (Not shown if not specified in the request)
x-rangekey: (Now shown if not specified in the request)
x-iterator: (Not shown if no iteration is required)

keyA=value
keyB=value
keyC=value
```

For the next iteration. (Also can be given as an option)
```
GET /db/key/#iterator HTTP/1.1
```

Options can be given in 2 ways
```
GET /db/key/?option1=value&option2=value&... HTTP/1.1

Or

GET /db/key/ HTTP/1.1
x-options: option1=value,option2=value,...
```

List of Options
* maxkey : Maximum number of keys (default: 1000)
* format : text | html | xml | json (default: text)
* keyonly : true | false (default false)
* encoding : url | hex | base64 (default: url)
* rangekey : last key for range request (if given perform until the specified key range, if not given perform prefix listing)
* delimiter : character for the boundary (ex: "/")
* keyfilter : regular expression to filter keys.
* iterator : Used for iteration

Response Codes
* 200 : Ok.
* 400 : Bad request.
* 500 : Internal server error

Response Headers
* Content-Type
* Content-Length
* x-key
* x-size
* x-format
* x-encoding
* x-iterator: Will be set if list is truncated by maxkey.
